    "Let's say you are given a few points:\n",
    "![image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/400px-Linear_regression.svg.png)\n",
    "To put it very simply, linear regression involves finding a line that passes through all these points, or as close to all the given points as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of points (x1,y1), (x2,y2)... , linear regression involves finding a slope (m) and an intercept (c) such that the line (Y = mX + c) \"fits\" the given set of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we measure \"close\" ? \n",
    "Usually, we use a metric called mean-squared-error (MSE). The error ('E' in MSE) is the difference between the output predicted by the line~ and the actual output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the point of this? What do I do with the line? \n",
    "We can use the equation of the line to predict the output (Y) for any given value input (X)."
